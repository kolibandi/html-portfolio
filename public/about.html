<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Ilker Turker. After studying architecture teaching at university, I delved into the world
of real estate valuation for many years. Music has been my passion since childhood, and during my youth, 
I made a living through music for about a decade. I also dabbled in darkroom photography for a couple of years
during my early years, worked at a local kebab restaurant, and apprenticed at barber shops.</p>

<p>About four years ago, I made the move from Turkey to England. However, neither my university major nor my 
subsequent career brought me true happiness. I always had the idea of pursuing music or finding another job 
that I could love. I have a great fondness for riding motorcycles. Upon moving to England, I decided to leave
behind all my past jobs and focus solely on activities that would give me peace of mind.</p>

<p>I started working as a courier because I enjoyed riding motorcycles, but eventually realized that what began 
as a way to entertain myself had turned into a prison of sorts. I found myself lacking my old skills, a sense
of responsibility, or any mentally stimulating activity. This situation gradually led me into a dark 
psychological slump. Now, at the age of 37, I knew I had to do something and break free from this dark 
room.</p>

<p>That's when my journey into software development began. I never set lofty goals for myself; I'm just having 
fun. I like to think that maybe one day, this could turn into a real job for me. As of the date of writing 
this, February 23, 2024, I've only been on this software journey for eight days. Yet, I'm already excited 
about learning new things. I'm aware that I'm just a grain of sand on a vast beach, but hopefully, one day 
in the future, I'll look back at this text and the date I wrote it, and say to myself, 
"Look at all the amazing things you've accomplished.</p>
